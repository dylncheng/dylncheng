I'm currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto.
<br>
<br>

ðŸ’¬ Here are some things about me:
- I enjoy working with the latest technologies in full-stack development and cloud
- I like to cook, play the piano and cello, and I'm occasionally looking around for a tennis court to play on
